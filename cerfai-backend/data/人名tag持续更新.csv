396,hong_meiling,hong_meiling,,,紅美鈴|くれないみすず|めいりん|龍美鈴|美鈴,"The ""Chinese Girl"", better known by her nickname ""China"" (中国, Chuugoku), which originated on 2ch during a debate about the proper reading of her name's kanji (some believed it to be the Japanese reading ""Kurenai Misuzu"", and it wasn't until later that ZUN revealed that the Chinese reading ""Hong Meiling"" is correct). Fans came to an agreement that her defining characteristic is being Chinese, and thus called her China. Stage 3 mid-boss and boss of Touhou's The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil and later a recurring playable character.A humanoid youkai (presumably resembling a Han Chinese) with blue or aqua eyes and long red hair with twin side braids. She works as the gatekeeper of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and specializes in Chinese martial arts. Unusually for a Touhou character, it is unclear what kind of youkai Meiling is, but many fans associate her with dragons. This is in part due to the star on her beret, which bears the Chinese character for ""dragon"" (龍, Long). Hong is also the name of a specific dragon from Chinese mythology, implying Meiling has some relation (popular assumption is father-daughter), or actually is Hong, leading to frequent depictions as a dragon girl. There are also occasional images that depict her as a panda.Fandom also often depicts Meiling as being lazy and ineffective at her job, and often being berated and/or punished for this by Izayoi Sakuya. In canon, however, her relationship with Sakuya is actually something closer to amicable co-workers, if not outright friendship, and she is generally very good at her job of repelling intruders, with the notable exception of Kirisame Marisa, who everyone else at the mansion admits is impossible to keep out when she wants access to Voile.","“中国女孩”，更出名的绰号是“中国”(中国, 《楚国》），起源于2月2日的一场关于她名字的汉字正确读法的辩论中（有人认为这是日本人读的“Kurenai Misuzu”，直到后来，尊才透露中文读的“Hong Meiling”是正确的）。歌迷们一致认为她的主要特征是中国人，因此称她为中国人。第三阶段头后的中老板和老板是猩红色魔鬼的化身，后来又是一个反复出现的可玩的角色。一个人形尤凯（大概像汉族人），蓝色或浅绿色的眼睛，红色长发，两边扎着辫子。她是红魔府的守门人，擅长中国武术。不寻常的是，对于一个土豪角色来说，还不清楚尤凯美玲是一个什么样的人，但是很多粉丝把她和龙联系在一起。部分原因是贝雷帽上的星星，上面有“龙”的汉字(龍, 长）。“红”也是中国神话中一个特定的龙的名字，暗示美玲有某种关系（流行的假设是父女关系），或者说实际上是“红”，这导致了频繁的龙女描写。偶尔也会有把她描绘成熊猫的画面，Fandom也经常把美玲描绘成懒惰和工作效率低下的人，并经常因此受到樱叶的斥责和/或惩罚。然而，在佳能中，她与樱叶的关系实际上更接近友好的同事，如果不是彻头彻尾的友谊的话，而且她通常非常擅长击退入侵者的工作，值得注意的是，除了Kirisame Marisa，在豪宅里的其他人都承认，当她想进入Voile时，不可能把她挡在门外。"

Described as being very ""wife-like"", since he enjoys doing domestic chores such as cleaning and laundry. Fanon exaggerates this to portray him as either Izumi-no-kami's fanboy, his servant, or his lover. Most fanarts have him be the aggressive party in their relationship however.During his Kiwame training, he infiltrates the Shinsengumi in order to train under his former master. He learned of why he and Izumi-no-Kami were chosen by Hijikata, and began to contemplate what meaning a ""famous"" sword had considering his humble origins. As he trains in the Shinsengumi, he realizes that it's the fact that most fights and attacks in this era were done primarily with swords that gives them meaning.

He is the older brother of the Awataguchi school swords, due to the fact that he was the only tachi ever forged by Awataguchi.Originally named ""Okatana Yoshimitsu"" (御刀吉光), Ichigo Hitofuri once belonged to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He ordered the blade to be shortened to match his rather short height. Ichigo Hitofuri was damaged in the summer of 1615 during the Siege of Osaka at Osaka Castle and then re-tempered by Yasutsugu under the order of Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, Ieyasu didn’t had the chance to use this sword because he was advised by the Priest Tenkai to avoid sending Hideyoshi’s swords (including Ichigo Hitofuri) to Edo.

However, it seems that he keeps things to himself, such as the fact that he's worried about losing his identity (since he was retempered in the past) and is secretly displeased about the Saniwa having so many swords. Fans enjoy portraying him as the big brother of the Awataguchi tantous, due to him being the biggest/tallest blade among Yoshimitsu's creations, not because he's the oldest among them. Either that, or he's presented as a foil to the prankster Tsurumaru.Because of his in-game elder brother status, many of the swords tend to call him ""Ichi-nii"" (Big brother Ichi), which extends to his nickname outside the game as well.","由Kanameyura设计的Touken Ranbu角色。Hitofuri的化身。他是Awataguchi学派剑的哥哥，因为他是Awataguchi铸造过的唯一的tachi。原名“Okatana Yoshimitsu”(御刀吉光), Hitofuri一郎曾经属于丰富美秀吉。他命令把刀刃缩短，以配合他那相当矮的身高。1615年夏天，在大阪城堡围攻大阪的过程中，Hitofuri一家遭到了破坏，随后在德川家康的命令下，由Yasutsugu重新调和。然而，Ieyasu没有机会使用这把剑，因为他是在天凯牧师的建议下避免把Hideyoshi的剑（包括Hitofuri一郎）送到江户的。从那时起，它就成了帝国的宝藏，和如沼、Uguisumaru和平野拓弘一起，他有着浅绿色的短发和黄色的眼睛。他戴着白手套，身穿军装，打着领带。一护有礼貌，谦逊的性格，并显示出关心他的兄弟们的福祉。然而，他似乎对自己隐瞒了一些事情，比如他担心失去自己的身份（因为他在过去被重新调整过），并且对萨尼瓦有这么多剑暗自不满。粉丝们喜欢把他描绘成淡田口tantous的老大哥，因为他是Yoshimitsu作品中最大/最高的刀刃，而不是因为他是其中年龄最大的。不管是这样，还是他被当作恶作剧大师如鲁鲁的陪衬，由于他在游戏中的哥哥地位，很多剑客都倾向于称他为“一日”（一日大哥），这也延伸到了他在游戏之外的昵称。"

Kiana is the daughter between ""The Elite of the Kaslana family"" - Siegfried Kaslana - and ""The Chosen One"" - Cecilia Schariac - born in a castle deep in the dense conifer forests of northern Europe on a snowy winter day. Her given name infers to a ""grace from god"" which ironically confers to later developments within the story itself.Shortly after Kiana's birth, they were dispatched to fight the Second Herrscherr(Sirin) in Siberia. While this is a long and complicated story, the basic gist is this — Cecilia Shariac, locked in battle with Sirin, ordered an airstrike on her position, sacrificing herself to kill Sirin. Depressed and shattered by his wife's death, Siegfried lost belief in Schicksal.At this point, Otto Apocalypse was already making plans to use Kiana's body.

When she was a child, Goenitz arrived at her home and demanded to talk with Gaidel, the leader of the village. He requested that Gaidel join him in their duties to serve Orochi, as everyone in the village were Orochi bloodline members. However, Gaidel refused as he and his family liked peace and not the violent tendencies created by the Orochi blood. Enraged, Goenitz leaves, but not before smiling towards Leona.

Goenitz, pleased by the results, puts her blood lust to rest for another time ""when he needs her again"".

Surprised by her natural fighting ability, he decides to raise her as a warrior under his command. In 1996, Leona is in her late teens and a capable mercenary. She receives her first official mission: she must take Heidern's place in the Ikari Team for the year's King of Fighters tournament. Her partners were Heidern's favorite mercenaries: Ralf and Clark. Their mission was to investigate Geese Howard, the South Town kingpin of crime, who had entered the tournament in search of an unknown goal. Knowing that anything Geese may be after could only mean trouble, the new Ikari Team began their mission. During the events of the '96 finals, Goenitz confronts her and reminds her of her Orochi lineage, causing her to worry about the future.Her troubled state carried over to the battlefield, which eventually lead to her and her partners' suspension from military service. Wanting to cheer her up, Ralf enlists them again in the next year's tournament. She eventually remembers her past fully during the events of King of Fighters '97.

By the tournament's end, she is successfully subdued and Orochi is sealed away again. Even so, Leona regrets her actions and attempts to end her life. Ralf stops her, and encourages her to continue living.Leona stays as a member of Ikari team for each and every King of Fighters tournaments during the NESTS saga.

She entered the Riot of the Blood again and attacked Ralf and Clark, badly injuring them. She was pulled out of the team by Heidern in The King of Fighters XI due to the emotional trauma she suffered after the incident. Overcoming the shock, she is designated to join the KOF XIII tournament with her old teammates, determined to live with whatever flaws the Orochi blood invokes. After the tournament's climax, she loses consciousness and sleeps for several days. Her teammates were worried for her and stay beside her until she awakens. Comforted by their concerns, she laughs for the first time in the series.She fights the same way as Heidern did, except she can now create a sphere that cuts everything around it as she screams.

She is referred to as ""Nipa"" by her friends. Her familiar is the Ermine.Nikka is affiliated with No.24 Squadron, an elite unit of the Suomus Air Force. As Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen is also a member of this squadron, the two are fellow squadron members.Nikka is something of a tomboy, bearing a boyish appearance and often unladylike manner. She was once something of a delinquent, which has since eased somewhat with the influence of her close friends such as Eila and Hanna Wind. She possesses a very exacting personality which usually splits any situation into right or wrong. While not stupid, she is relatively guileless and often distracted, making her a popular subject for Eila's pranks.Nikka is based on the Finnish flying ace Nils Katajainen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Katajainen ).

He got angry and threw the dagger, and then the dagger pierced directly through a yagen (a stone mill for medicinal herbs). The dagger gained the reputation for never damaging its master but sharp.

For both outfits he wears shorts and black kneehighs.Known for being very mature and reliable, and having a very deep voice despite his youthful appearance.

Extra Stage boss and Phantasm stage midboss of Touhou's Perfect Cherry Blossom.Yakumo Yukari's 800+-year-old kyuubi kitsune shikigami who specializes in black magic. She is also powerful enough to have her own shikigami, a nekomata named Chen, to whom she is portrayed to act motherly towards prominently in fanworks.In volume two of Strange Creators of Outer World, it has been revealed that Ran is actually a shikigami parasitically taking host of a nine-tailed fox youkai so strongly that it never shows on the surface; leading people to not have any difficulty seeing her as a kitsune. However, this seemed to be subtlety hinted at in Yukari's Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red article where Yukari constantly repeats to Aya that Ran is a shikigami and not an animal.Ran has been described to have a gentle personality and to be a lover of fried tofu like her kitsune body. She excels at mathematics and is able to solve nigh impossible equations instantly; simply seeing it as a hobby to kill time. She is rather robotic in nature when it comes to following Yukari's orders whereas Ran herself describes them as ""Yukari's programming"". Due to her master's prominent sleeping habits, Ran is usually doing her bidding at a constant. However, Yukari herself has stated that she would like to see Ran do something other than simply follow her orders.Ran is simply seen as a tool that's loved in Yukari's eyes. If she is to ever stray away from her duties as a shikigami or to forget that she is one; she is to be violently disciplined, such as being beaten on the head by her parasol.She is notorious in many doujins as a streaker, earning her the nickname Suppa Tenko (""Naked Heavenly Fox""), and for bursting into an excessive nosebleed if Chen does anything exceptionally cute.",“九尾战略家”。额外的舞台老板和幻觉舞台中老板的头后的完美樱花。Yakumo Yukari的800岁以上的kyuubi kitsune shikigami谁擅长黑魔法。她也有足够的力量拥有她自己的shikigami，一个叫陈的nekomata，在fanworks中，她被描绘成一个母亲般的角色，据透露，冉其实是一个石鸡寄生主机的九尾狐优开如此强烈，它从来没有出现在表面；引导人们不要有任何困难，把她看作一个风筝。然而，这似乎是微妙的暗示在Yukari的波西米亚档案在日本红色文章中，Yukari不断重复阿雅，冉是一个shikigami，而不是动物。冉被描述为有一个温和的个性，是一个喜欢炸豆腐喜欢她的kitsune机构。她擅长数学，能立即解出几乎不可能的方程；只是把它当作消磨时间的爱好。她是相当机器人的性质，当谈到以下尤卡里的命令，而冉自己形容他们为“尤卡里的编程”。由于主人的睡眠习惯很好，冉女士通常都是按部就班地工作。然而，尤卡里自己也表示，她希望看到冉做一些事情，而不是简单地按照她的命令。冉只是被视为一个工具，在尤卡里的眼睛喜欢。如果她离开了她作为一个shikigami的职责或者忘记了她是一个shikigami；她将受到严厉的管教，例如被阳伞打在头上。她在许多斗锦人中以裸奔而臭名昭著，因此她被昵称为Suppa Tenko（“裸体天狐”），如果陈做了任何特别可爱的事，她就会流鼻血。

Her alternate outfit is a purple frilled dress with puffy short sleeves and elbow gloves. Has long blonde hair with red ribbons along the length of the hair and either purple or yellow eyes (official art is contradictory in this regard), with purple eyes being more common. Yukari has the power to manipulate boundaries, as well as create gaps, leading to her nickname ""Sukima"". However, she frequently holds back her powers and most of the time she only goes as far as playfully dragging any unsuspecting human from the outside world into Gensoukyou.in Silent Sinner in Blue she has two pet crows - Zenki and Goki.Besides her servants, she is friends with Ibuki Suika, Saigyouji Yuyuko (whom she knew from as early as the latter's days as a human) and Hakurei Reimu (the other barrier guardian, whom she sometimes pesters).
